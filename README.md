Apex Legends Game using Unity
Apex Legends is a rst person shooter (FPS) game. Before the match, players form
into two- or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed characters with distinctive
abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay modes. In "Battle Royale", up
to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons
and supplies before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play
area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else nd themselves
outside the play area which can be fatal. The nal team alive wins the round. In "Arenas",
players form into three-player squads and ght against another squad in a 3v3 team
deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win
when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.
